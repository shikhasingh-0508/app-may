//Important Points
//Screen is Divide Two Parts : appBar and body
//Everything on Screen is a Widget for Flutter .
//Two Types of Widgets- Statless and Statefull
//StatlessWidget - It does not change or update on screen
//StatefullWidget - It gets update When Data is Changing / UI will update too
//UI -The Screen- User Interface - What user sees on screen

//class - Blueprint/Design/Template For My Screen
